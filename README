Risk and uncertainty

Due to shared maps, advertisements and recommendations, in 2020, it is quite a bit more likely to explain thngs that were once passed away as coincidence -- to explain them even more accurately as coincidence.

What pops to my mind is two fold:

1. an overlay system, similiar to GPS, but more specificaly modeled after
 the usefullness of the transparency overlays that were common for advanced
 proposals and demonstrations before the computer age made such a thing
simpler -- and sometimes less used.

 One reason this phenomenon is not fully explored is that the entirety of 
 an organisms periodic GPS route is much more telling that a set of heuristic
or programmatic-condition generated "points". Great capability brings to
question who can safely use this technology.

2. Game theories as spearheaded by Nuemann
 It is my opinion that game theory is the fundamental building block(s)
of modern AI.

	a. Spreadsheets are probably not the best way


Observation 2. maybe not at lower end schools
